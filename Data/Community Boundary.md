# Richmond-San Pablo Community Boundary and Focus Areas (2019)

This file contains the Richmond-San Pablo AB617 community boundary as defined by the Steering Committee on June 2019. 

## Problem Statement

The purpose of this dataset is to help identify a boundary for the [Community Air Monitoring and Emissions Reduction Plans](https://www.baaqmd.gov/community-health/community-health-protection-program/richmond-area-community-health-protection-program).

## Analysis Parameters

Use Steering Committee input and information on emissions sources, air quality and health screening data, population density, locations of sensitive receptors, and existing municipality and other geographic boundaries to establish a study boundary for the AB 617 Richmond-San Pablo community air monitoring plan. 

## Methodology applied to solve problem

The Air District worked with the Steering Committee to identify data sets and information that would be useful to help establish a study boundary. These data sets included locations of emissions sources, population density, locations of sensitive receptors, and air quality and health data from available screening tools. The Air District created maps using GIS to help summarize these spatial data sets and presented them to the Steering Committee. Steering Committee members reviewed these materials and added their input on high-priority community air quality concerns. The Air District then prepared a boundary that incorporated Steering Committee input and included high-priority areas of concern. This boundary was subsequently used as the study boundary for collecting air quality screening data in Richmond-San Pablo.

## Expected Outcomes

Community boundary will be used by anyone conducting spatial analysis for the Richmond-San Pablo community as defined under AB617.
