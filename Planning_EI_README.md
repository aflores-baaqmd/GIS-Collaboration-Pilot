# Richmond Planning Inventory

## Problem Statement
As part of the technical assessment performed for an AB 617 community, a planning inventory is developed
for all sources of criteria pollutants and air toxics in the community. In this inventory, emissions are
reported by 14-digit Emission Inventory Code (EIC). A draft planning EI was recently developed for the
Richmond-San Pablo (RSP) community for the year 2017.

## Project Management

## Data Sources
The following sources of data were used in the development of this draft EI:
* 2017 CEIDARS data from BAAQMD's E&CEA Section (point sources)
* Emissions from CARB's SIP v1.05 inventory (area and offroad sources)
* Emissions from CARB's EMFAC2017 model (onroad sources)
* 1-km spatial surrogate data from CARB's modeling team

## Analysis Parameters

## Methodology Applied to Solve Problem
The Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) model, version 4.7, was used to allocate facility-
and county-level emissions to BAAQMD's 1-km modeling domain. Emissions for grid cells previously
defined as the RSP analysis boundary were extracted and summed to create the draft planning inventory.

## Expected Outcomes
The draft planning inventory for Richmond was submitted to CARB for review, and BAAQMD staff are
working with CARB to address questions on the data. Eventually, bottom-up emission estimates will
be prepared for key sources in RSP, and these updated data will be incorporated into the final
planning EI for the community.

## Results
Final results are pending the development of bottom-up inventory elements.
