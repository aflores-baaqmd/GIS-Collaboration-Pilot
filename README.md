# GIS-Collaboration-Pilot (2020)

This repository provides detailed documention of work performed by Air District and MTC staff for the MTC-BAAQMD Collaboration Pilot Project.

## Problem Statement

This project is a proof of concept for how the Air District might better manage agency datasets internally and externally. Project includes training on all the resources MTC currently employs to manage spatial and non-spatial datasets, upload of project data to those resources, adding of metadata and finalization of project documentation.

## Analysis Parameters

The Air District will work with MTC staff to set up a test project that includes a well-documented geospatial database and ESRI “GIS project” that can support collaboration, uses best practices and standards for documentation and transparency. The test project will include one or two regional datasets, for example city and county boundaries and/or census tract geographies. The goal of this test project is to develop and refine the protocols and practices that will be used to create more complex geospatial databases and GIS projects. 

Deliverables include:

- A jointly prepared data access protocol and/or associated scripts that accesses/extracts the test case datasets;
- A jointly prepared ESRI GIS project; and
- A jointly prepared README file, or other metadata/documentation, describing the test project dataset(s).


## Methodology applied to solve problem

- Training on resources
- Data finalization and uploads
- Data metadata
- Data documentation


## Expected Outcomes

Successful upload of the Richmond-San Pablo Community Boundary on ArcGIS Online and Socrata with full documentation on GitHub.
